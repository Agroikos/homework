Intro to java homework
Implement in java the following algorithms:
1. Calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers higher than 0
2. Display the smallest number from an array of number (2 versions: with normal for and with
foreach)
3. Display the max digit from a number.
4. Check if a number is palindrome( e.g palindrome 1221, 34143)
5. Display all the prime numbers lower than a given number
6. Change the implementation of the calculator from the previous meeting to use only if-else
instead of switch.
7. Change the implementation of the calculator from the previous meeting to not stop after
one calculation. (Hint: put switch inside a while loop)
8. Calculate and display the factorial of a given number n. (ex: 4! = 1*2*3*4)
