Sturgeon’s law is the adage that “ninety percent of everything is crap”.
This represents the belief that in general, the vast majority of the work which is produced in any given field
is of low quality. For example, when it comes to books, Sturgeon’s law suggests that 90% of the books that come
out each year are relatively bad.

This principle is a beneficial rule of thumb, since keeping it in mind can help improve the way in which
you assess and consume information, as well as the way in which you decide what projects to work on.
As such, in the following article, you will learn more about Sturgeon’s law, see examples of it in various domains,
 and understand how you can apply it as a helpful guiding principle in many areas of life.
