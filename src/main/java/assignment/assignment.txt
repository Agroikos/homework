You need to design an application that allows the possibility to calculate the surface and perimeter
for multiple types of shape: rectangle, square, circle and triangle.


The tool should allow the possibility to add multiple shapes and calculate the total sum for perimeter and for surface.


Also, the application should make sure that 2 similar shapes couldnâ€™t be added to the drawing tool.
In case 2 similar shapes are added, an appropriate message should be printed to console.


Since you want to be sure that you provide a high quality implementation, unit tests are needed to prove the main
functionalities described above, work correctly (add all types of shapes, add duplicates, add single shape and pairs
of shapes).


To deliver the work, just push it to the homework repository in a separate package called assignment.
